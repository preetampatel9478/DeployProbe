# DeployProbe

DeployProbe is a web application that tests if deployed websites can handle traffic storms and analyzes code quality for scalability.

## Overview

DeployProbe helps you understand if your website is ready for high traffic situations by simulating load, analyzing code quality, and providing actionable insights. Perfect for developers preparing for product launches or marketing campaigns that might drive sudden traffic spikes.

## Features

- **Load testing simulation** with customizable user capacity
- **Traffic storm handling** assessment (5,000-10,000+ users)
- **Code quality analysis** focused on scalability
- **Mobile responsiveness** checking
- **Page speed measurement**
- **Content assessment**
- **High concurrency testing**
- **Scalability recommendations**

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set in your deployment environment:

- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to "true" to enable debug mode (default: "false")
- `PORT`: The port on which the application will run (default: 5000)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeployProbe.git
   cd DeployProbe
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

## How to Use DeployProbe

1. Enter the URL of the website you want to test
2. Specify the target user capacity (e.g., 5000 users)
3. Click "Launch Test" to begin the analysis
4. View the comprehensive report that includes:
   - Basic site accessibility
   - Code quality score
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Page load speed
   - Estimated user capacity
   - High traffic readiness assessment
   - Scalability recommendations

## Understanding Your Results

The test results include multiple sections:

- **Site Status**: Confirms if your site is accessible
- **Load Test**: Shows how your site performs under simulated traffic
- **Scalability Analysis**: Estimates how many concurrent users your site can handle
- **Code Quality**: Analyzes implementation best practices for high-traffic sites
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Checks if your site is optimized for mobile devices
- **Page Speed**: Measures load time and performance

## The Storm Creator

âš¡ **Shivpujan Kumar** - The mad scientist who believed websites should be tested like they're going through a hurricane. While most developers pray their sites don't crash, he built a tool to simulate the storm and watch the chaos. If your site survives DeployProbe, it can probably survive the apocalypse too!

When not brewing digital tempests to torture innocent websites, Shivpujan can be found reading server logs like they're poetry and explaining to non-technical friends that "No, turning it off and on again isn't always the solution... but it works surprisingly often."
